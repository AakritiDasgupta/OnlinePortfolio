          <p>As a member of the Engineering academy I have met many professionals through the countless field trips and guest speakers that we have had the opportunity to learn from. These professionals have taught me invaluable lessons such as learning the importance of a bigger picture,the need to keep working towards your goal and why Scrum is such a useful tool to make sure everyone pitches in. </p>

          <h3 style="color:#3f246b">Joe Vierra</h3>
          <p>We had a guest speaker named Joe Vierra who had been a former CTO of several large companies before working on start ups. Some key takeaways from his presentation was the concepts of speed, perfection and reality checks. Speed is critical to ensure proficiency and efficiency. Having speed ensures that your solution stays relevant in the world and ensures that your idea stays original. He also talked about how you should not let the idea of perfection come in the way. Instead, focus on building a solution as fast as possible and get it out to a customer. Use their criticism to fix it, rather that your own idea of it. Finally, he explained that a person has to be realistic. The grand vision of the start up must be attainable and always in mind. Additionally, he talked about being realistic in his planning. Challenges can come at any time and you have to have the leeway to modify the plan to overcome hardships. Something that inspired me from his career was the fact that he emphasized how important keeping the bigger picture in mind is. I have always thought that it’s the small things that matter, but Mr. Vierra helped me understand that the bigger picture matter most and that you shouldn’t strive let perfection get in the way of your vision.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#3f246b">Cesar Nicola</h3>
        <p>Cesar Nicola was another one of our guest speakers. He was from Uruguay and has been working with IT for the past 15 years. He was talking about how he’s managed teams using the Agile and Scrum methodology. In his presentation he had gone through agile processes and explained how they work. We paid more attention to an agile process called Scrum.We had brushed over Scrum methodology in my Computer Science Principles class but had not spent too much time on it. So when I heard about his topic I was instantly captivated. Through his presentation I was able to fully grasp why Scrum is better that the normal Waterfall methodology. At one point of his presentation he had talked about one of his workshops and it helped me understand how easy it was to implement changes with scrum methodology. Their team was able to easily change their design to match the clients constantly changing requests. It allowed them to make a solution that had allowed them to keep the clients requests in their mind. With waterfall methodology it would have dragged on till the end and the result would not have been able to accommodate the client's later designs. He also discussed all the steps of scrum in detail and gone through the values that scrum promotes. While explaining scrum he had given us a real life example of a project being run through scrum. That example helped me understand why Scrum does not allow anyone to sit idly. The backlogs and daily meetings had brought light on how everyone is doing and seemed to give people the opportunity to ask for help. </p>

        <h3 style="color:#3f246b">JA Salesforce Job Shadow</h3>
        <p>I had gone on a virtual field trip to the JA Salesforce Job Shadow that was organized by Salesforce. We met a lot of people in the salesforce and everyone there helped me learn just how important communication is in a workplace. Throughout the meeting we met a lot of people who shared their journeys and explained the importance of listening. I was able to learn that being a good employee is more than just working hard. YOu need to understand how to communicate your problems and ideas, while also making sure you know how to listen. A good employee should be able to listen to others opinions and try to understand their perspective. Another key lesson is that everyone should take care of their offices and surroundings as well. The office should get as much respect as you would give to other people.  </p>

        <h3 style="color:#3f246b">Annabel Gomez</h3>
        <p>Ms. Gomez also helped me see how crucial passion is. In Annabel’s presentation, she radiated passion and embodied what passion could look like in a person. For example, in the presentation, she displayed a video of her walking in a creation that they made and she was having so much fun. She also was in a research program in CalTech due to a program she applied to. It was clear here that she had gone above and beyond to learn more about her field of interests. She sent many emails and cold calls in hopes of finding an internship, attesting to the fact that she is very passionate about her field of studies. She had started her sadness at being rejected but not once did she ever stop tying. She was enjoying the process and embracing every turn of it, even if some of it was tough. Of course, everyone hears the lecture on the importance of passion. I have also seen many examples but Annabel drove that point home for me. Seeing how far she got following her passion makes me more sure of myself and the path that I want to take in my life.
