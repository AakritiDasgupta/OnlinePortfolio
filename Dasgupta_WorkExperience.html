        <p> We had a guest speaker named Joe Vierra who had been a former CTO of several large companies before working on start ups. Some key takeaways from his presentation was the concepts of speed, perfection and reality checks. Speed is critical to ensure proficiency and efficiency. Having speed ensures that your solution stays relevant in the world and ensures that your idea stays original. He also talked about how you should not let the idea of perfection come in the way. Instead, focus on building a solution as fast as possible and get it out to a customer. Use their criticism to fix it, rather that your own idea of it. Finally, he explained that a person has to be realistic. The grand vision of the start up must be attainable and always in mind. Additionally, he talked about being realistic in his planning. Challenges can come at any time and you have to have the leeway to modify the plan to overcome hardships. Something that inspired me from his career was the fact that he emphasized how important keeping the bigger picture in mind is. I have always thought that it’s the small things that matter, but Mr. Vierra helped me understand that the bigger picture matter most and that you shouldn’t strive let perfection get in the way of your vision.</p>
