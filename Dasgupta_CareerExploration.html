          <h3 style="color:#3f246b">Joe Vierra</h3>
          <p>During a recent guest speaker presentation by Joe Vierra, a former CTO of several large companies and current startup expert, I gained valuable insights on the importance of speed, realism, and avoiding perfectionism in the pursuit of innovation. Mr. Vierra emphasized that speed is critical to ensure proficiency and efficiency in today's fast-paced world. He urged us to focus on building solutions as fast as possible and getting them out to customers, even if they're not perfect. By doing so, we can incorporate customer feedback to improve our ideas, rather than relying solely on our own vision of perfection. He also stressed the importance of being realistic, both in our planning and in our overall startup vision. Challenges are inevitable, and we must be flexible enough to modify our plans to overcome them. Most importantly, Mr. Vierra inspired me by emphasizing the significance of keeping the bigger picture in mind. While small details matter, it's crucial to never lose sight of our grander vision, and not to let perfectionism hinder our progress.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#3f246b">Cesar Nicola</h3>
        <p>Cesar Nicola was a guest speaker whose presentation was focussed on his insights regarding managing teams using Agile/Scrum methodology. During his presentation, he walked us through the Scrum process and provided some scenarios where this methodology could serve to be more effective than the traditional Waterfall methodology.

One key takeaway from his presentation was when he shared a real-life example of a project that was run using Scrum methodology. He explained how his team was able to adapt to changing client requests and keep everyone on track through daily meetings and backlogs via using Scrum methodology. Beyond understanding the methodology, this helped me highlight the importance of being flexible and responsive when working on difficult projects.

Another key takeaways from his presentation was the importance of communication and collaboration. Scrum promotes a culture of transparency and accountability, creating an environment where people provide support to those in need. This can help prevent the miscommunication, that is often an unintended consequence of Waterfall methodology. 

Overall, Cesar's presentation was incredibly insightful and valuable. It helped me deepen my understanding of Agile and Scrum methodology and inspired me to seek out more opportunities to learn from experts in the field. </p>

Additionally, she provided me with valuable resources to pursue my interests individually, such as attending start-up conventions and high-school internships. Her presentation helped me identify new paths to explore after high school, which has made the transition to college less daunting.

Furthermore, meeting Ms. Jain, a successful DEDA program alumna, helped me understand how the skills learned in this program can translate into work opportunities and life beyond high school. As a college speaker, she also gave me valuable insights into the college application process and the different types of degrees available at UC Berkeley. Overall, Ms. Jain's talk was an excellent source of inspiration and guidance, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to have learned from her.

        <p>I had the opportunity to tour the Clorox factory in Pleasanton where I got to visit their scaled-down laboratories and learn about their production line and day in the life of someone who works at Clorox. I got to see how Clorox conducts its experiments, whether they be larger in scale or smaller variations. We often overlook the minute details in our everyday products, not giving a second-thought about the chemistry behind our cleaning products. Prior to this tour I did not anticipate the thought and experimentation required to ensure that clorox wipes retained their moisture without dripping onto the table or absorbing completely into the cloth. I underestimated the amount of testing required to create a strong cleaning agent that is not toxic or harmful to our skin. Additionally, I was unaware of the far-reaching spread of the Clorox company. I always associated Clorox with cleaning products without looking into subsidiary companies they own such as Burt’s Bees, Glad and Nature’s Products.
