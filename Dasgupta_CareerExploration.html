          <p>I have been a  member of the Engineering academy for the past 4 years and have met countless professionals through the numerous field trips and guest speakers I have  the opportunity to learn from. These professionals have taught me invaluable lessons such as learning the importance of a bigger picture,the need to keep working towards your goal, and why Scrum is such a useful tool to make sure everyone pitches in. Below are more detailed accounts of my field trips, guest speakers, and mentor. </p>

          <h3 style="color:#3f246b">Joe Vierra</h3>
          <p>We had a guest speaker named Joe Vierra who had been a former CTO of several large companies before working on start ups. Some key takeaways from his presentation was the concepts of speed, perfection and reality checks. Speed is critical to ensure proficiency and efficiency. Having speed ensures that your solution stays relevant in the world and ensures that your idea stays original. He also talked about how you should not let the idea of perfection come in the way. Instead, focus on building a solution as fast as possible and get it out to a customer. Use their criticism to fix it, rather that your own idea of it. Finally, he explained that a person has to be realistic. The grand vision of the start up must be attainable and always in mind. Additionally, he talked about being realistic in his planning. Challenges can come at any time and you have to have the leeway to modify the plan to overcome hardships. Something that inspired me from his career was the fact that he emphasized how important keeping the bigger picture in mind is. I have always thought that it’s the small things that matter, but Mr. Vierra helped me understand that the bigger picture matter most and that you shouldn’t strive let perfection get in the way of your vision.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#3f246b">Cesar Nicola</h3>
        <p>Cesar Nicola was another one of our guest speakers. He was from Uruguay and has been working with IT for the past 15 years. He was talking about how he’s managed teams using the Agile and Scrum methodology. In his presentation he had gone through agile processes and explained how they work. We paid more attention to an agile process called Scrum.We had brushed over Scrum methodology in my Computer Science Principles class but had not spent too much time on it. So when I heard about his topic I was instantly captivated. Through his presentation I was able to fully grasp why Scrum is better that the normal Waterfall methodology. At one point of his presentation he had talked about one of his workshops and it helped me understand how easy it was to implement changes with scrum methodology. Their team was able to easily change their design to match the clients constantly changing requests. It allowed them to make a solution that had allowed them to keep the clients requests in their mind. With waterfall methodology it would have dragged on till the end and the result would not have been able to accommodate the client's later designs. He also discussed all the steps of scrum in detail and gone through the values that scrum promotes. While explaining scrum he had given us a real life example of a project being run through scrum. That example helped me understand why Scrum does not allow anyone to sit idly. The backlogs and daily meetings had brought light on how everyone is doing and seemed to give people the opportunity to ask for help. </p>

        <h3 style="color:#3f246b">JA Salesforce Job Shadow</h3>
        <p>I had gone on a virtual field trip to the JA Salesforce Job Shadow that was organized by Salesforce. We met a lot of people in the salesforce and everyone there helped me learn just how important communication is in a workplace. Throughout the meeting we met a lot of people who shared their journeys and explained the importance of listening. I was able to learn that being a good employee is more than just working hard. YOu need to understand how to communicate your problems and ideas, while also making sure you know how to listen. A good employee should be able to listen to others opinions and try to understand their perspective. Another key lesson is that everyone should take care of their offices and surroundings as well. The office should get as much respect as you would give to other people.  </p>

        <h3 style="color:#3f246b">Annabel Gomez</h3>
        <p>Ms. Gomez also helped me see how crucial passion is. In Annabel’s presentation, she radiated passion and embodied what passion could look like in a person. For example, in the presentation, she displayed a video of her walking in a creation that they made and she was having so much fun. She also was in a research program in CalTech due to a program she applied to. It was clear here that she had gone above and beyond to learn more about her field of interests. She sent many emails and cold calls in hopes of finding an internship, attesting to the fact that she is very passionate about her field of studies. She had started her sadness at being rejected but not once did she ever stop tying. She was enjoying the process and embracing every turn of it, even if some of it was tough. Of course, everyone hears the lecture on the importance of passion. I have also seen many examples but Annabel drove that point home for me. Seeing how far she got following her passion makes me more sure of myself and the path that I want to take in my life.

        <h3 style="color:#3f246b">Donald James</h3>
        <p>Another notable guest speaker was Donald James, a former employee at NASA who shared his wisdom through his novel, Manners will take you where brains and money won’t. As the title of his novel suggests, the most important takeaway from his speech was the importance of manners. Throughout my life I have about of the importance of a handshake, but Mr. James took it a step further imforming me about the importance of authentic encounters, the true definition of manners. While recounting his memories regarding how going beyond a simple handshake led to the creation of numerous relationships, I saw how that Mr.James' manners helped him find purpose of fulfillment in his workplace. As a man who spent 35 years in public affairs at NASA, Mr.James' wisdom imformed me of the importance of expressing dignity and etiquette at every interaction. Seeing Mr.James build meaningful relationships with those at work helped me understand the importance of having good manners and approaching every encounter with authenticity and excitement.

        <h3 style="color:#3f246b">Trishala Jain </h3>
        <p>Ms.Jain, an alumna of the DEDA program, is currently enrolled in the MET program at UC Berkeley. Her presentation focussed on finding an intersection for those interested in business and engineering, discussing programs and opportunities for those interested. As someone whose goals are aligned with technological innovation but also to empower others, creating a solid foundation in business is just as important as establishing one in engineering. With college season coming up, I struggled to find a program that combined both these passions promptly and Ms. Jain’s talk not only introduced me to the MET/EECS program, which allows me to graduate with two degrees in 4 years but also gave me resources to explore these passions individually through start-up conventions and high-school internships. She provided me with new paths to take after high school, making the process of transitioning to college less daunting. Additionally, meeting an alumna of the DEDA program helped me understand how skills learned through this program transfer to work-opportunities and life beyond high school. Finally, meeting a speaker in college helped me better understand the college application process and the different types of degrees at Berkeley.

        <p>I had the opportunity to tour the Clorox factory in Pleasanton where I got to visit their scaled-down laboratories and learn about their production line and day in the life of someone who works at Clorox. I got to see how Clorox conducts its experiments, whether they be larger in scale or smaller variations. We often overlook the minute details in our everyday products, not giving a second-thought about the chemistry behind our cleaning products. Prior to this tour I did not anticipate the thought and experimentation required to ensure that clorox wipes retained their moisture without dripping onto the table or absorbing completely into the cloth. I underestimated the amount of testing required to create a strong cleaning agent that is not toxic or harmful to our skin. Additionally, I was unaware of the far-reaching spread of the Clorox company. I always associated Clorox with cleaning products without looking into subsidiary companies they own such as Burt’s Bees, Glad and Nature’s Products.

        <h3 style="color:#3f246b">Oracle Jobshadow</h3>
        <p>The oracle job shadow was a unique virtual field trip that provided me with the opportunity to meet numerous professionals at Oracle via breakout rooms. Initially we all attended a presentation conducted by VP of Engineering where we learnt about their job responsibilities as well as his journey to engineering. After this presentation we were broken down into groups that rotated breakout rooms allowing us to meet everyone from engineers to those leaning towards sales. This opportunity allowed me to explore different career paths and learn the importance of goal-setting. Numerous presenters shared a sense of communication and goal-setting, explaining the importance of developing communicative skills early to ensure strong team-work and creating personalized goals to ensure growth and prevent feelings of imposter-syndrome. Meeting with these professionals also provided me with insight into the working world, providing me with the glimpse of skills and pathways in the workforce industry.

        <p>From June 2022 to November 2022 I worked under a fractionalized CTO to better understand the responsibilities of a CTO. I was exposed to real-world examples and projects such as taking on research projects on various topics. The outcome of this were articles published on the company website about the best ways to select vendors, importance of analytical tools, and how CTO’s help improve business. Through this internship I was able to grasp an understanding of google analytics and learn how to handle sensitive data and account for client requests. Finally, this internship taught me how to balance my schedule and time effectively and communicate with peers in a business setting.

        <p>During the mentorship program I was paired with Rupert Young and learnt numerous lessons.Firstly, I learned about the importance of avoiding procrastination. Through numerous discussions, I was able to see that procrastination can not only take a toll on our health but also takes a toll on the quality of work, affecting the overall ability to learn. Mr. Young and I also thoroughly discussed the importance of balance in success and I learned a great lot about the importance of giving and taking. I often get caught up in academic success and forget to notice the toll that can take on my relationships with everyone around me. This mentorship was also vital in helping me set quantifiable personal goals. Our meetings also helped me learn about the interviewing process and gain the feedback necessary to become better at the interview process.Mr.Young's feedback regarding maintaining eye contact and doing practice problems for more technical questions helped me pass the interview for my internship. I found the mentorship to be incredibly helpful and plan on implementing the lessons learnt through those interactions.
