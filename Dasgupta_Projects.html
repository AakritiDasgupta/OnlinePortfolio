          <p style="color:#3f246b">For this project, we were assigned the task to create a game or story with multiple levels/acts that progressed towards a specific goal or storyline. My partner and I weighed various options and narrowed them down to create a racing game using the Scratch programming language. The game involved a fast pace chase between bank robbers and the police. The game was designed to become progressively gain speed with the player/robber getting a car upgrade after the successful completion of each level. The project was designed for us to enhance our skills using Scratch, a programming language, and understand its possibilities and limitations. Another essential aspect of this project was for us to learn and understand the importance of proper documentation - clear instructions, proper design documents, and outlining one's daily activities were the key points. My partner and I understood our strengths and weakness and distributed the work accordingly. However, we also ensured that each one of us worked on aspects that were out of our comfort zone. We faced challenges around communication and overcame them through emails. Additionally, we peer-reviewed each other's work which helped us get insight into each other's perspectives and improved the overall quality of our game. A critical lesson that we learned with this project was that we must always design a game or a product keeping in mind the perspective of the end-user or player. In the spirit of making the game complicated, we must not forget to acknowledge the entertainment aspect of the game.</p>

        <p style="color:#3f246b">For this project, we were assigned to use the SCRUM methodology to make a hangman game in 45-50 minutes. However, we must ensure that we use the given code and also include a theme. After a few ideas being bounced around the four of us concluded that the theme of the game is Harry Potter. This means our hangman game will have different Harry Potter-related terms each round. Our first step was to divide the work to prevent any confusion. After the discussion, I was to work on the scrum planning, backlog, and review, and in any free time, I would help check and finish the code. This project opened my eyes to a different way of documentation. I learned about SCRUM methodology and how that gives people flexibility and gives no room for slacking off. We had to add details at different times and this documentation allowed us to easily implement these changes. This method also ensured that all members are working simultaneously. Our greatest challenge was the time restraint as we had never had such a tight time constraint. Although we were overwhelmed we understood that communication was key. We had to ensure that all of us knew what was expected of us and ask for help when we needed it. I think our communication was easy because we all could admit our strengths and weaknesses. That confession allowed us to easily divide the work into equal chunks for everyone. Our problem-solving skills also allowed us to be flexible and with the SCRUM methodology, we were able to easily delete and add things to our project.</p>

          <p style="color:#3f246b">Our aim for this project was to create a trap that can humanely capture Santa but ensure that he was released. My responsibility in this project consisted of handling the documentation, formatting, and build a portion of the actual prototype. Our group had split up the work for this project by delegating tasks to people rather than splitting every part of the project evenly. This process of assigning tasks allowed me to understand how to split up work efficiently. While also being able to capitalize on one's best skills. Since this was a socially distanced project, I was able to further my understanding of the importance of communication. While also teaching me how to work with people without necessarily being face to face. This class also introduced me to a more thorough form of documentation, specifically teaching me how to create a Design Brief and a Final Design Description.

          <p style="color:#3f246b">Our aim for this project was to create a two-lane bridge over Trinity Lake that must be 12 -24 meters above water level. In this project, I was the project manager and my job consisted of assigning tasks and making sure everyone finishes their work in a timely fashion. I also handled the majority of the documentation in this project. Through this project, I learned the importance of being able to ask for help. I have always loved doing documentation and hence took over the majority of it this time as well. However, as the days went by I found myself struggling and spending countless hours attempting to figure it out myself. Through this process, I learned how to tell my other partners that I was struggling. I understood the importance of relying on my partners for help instead of braving it myself. This project also helped further my understanding of bridges and brought to light the amount of work behind building a bridge.

          <p style="color:#3f246b">Our aim for this project was to successfully create a board game, that not only demonstrated our knowledge of java but was also entertaining. We were not required to complete any documentation for this project so our team agreed upon splitting up the code into bite-sized sections. We then, evenly, split these bite-sized sections between all three of us. One of the lessons that I took from this project was the importance of avoiding procrastination. This project was challenging and required us to think innovatively. Due to the difficulty and ambiguity of this project, we were initially given three weeks. During the first two weeks, I found myself putting this project aside and focusing on other tasks. At this point, the class was also given a one-week extension. Instead, of using this extension wisely I decided to, again, put the project on hold and focus on other tasks. Another extension was given to the entire class. During this time my team I was finally able to break out of this cycle of procrastination and diligently worked on our project. We collaborated and were pleased with our end result. However, through this project, I was able to learn that procrastination only makes a task harder. Instead of avoiding a daunting task, one should jump in and embrace the challenges; As I was also able to learn a great deal from this project.

          <p style="color:#3f246b">Amazon brought stores to the comfort of our home. This allowed many people to cut down the number of trips we make to the store. However, returns have kept us going back to the store. In today’s world, returning items have become a nuisance often resulting in hassles that we no longer have the patience to handle. To help overcome this problem I have come up with the idea to create a website that can allow clients to return their items from the comfort of their home.My idea was to build a website that allows the user to return items from the comfort of their homes. The user has to input their address, seller, order id and return id. This information is then stored in a database that the driver should have access to. Although I didn't get to this part, the driver should have the orders sorted by a sorting algorithm that sorts from quickest return to longest return. In the time frame we were given I was able to build out the client side aspect of it. By that I mean I was able to build a website for the application. The website them took the information from the html form and stored it in the database. The architecture of this model is displayed in the image below.The architecture consists of two cloud platforms, google cloud platform and AWS cloud platform. First, lets start of with google cloud platform where I used the Maps API since it has an excellent map APIS. Then in the AWS, I created an EC2 instance and installed apache web server on it, since we need a web server. We used html,css, and javascript at the front end. We also used python 3.7 to code out the project and stored the data in the MySQL Database. To convert the python code into an API we used Flask. The html form calls the API. Finally, we also used an S3 bucket to store images which we called using javascript to the front end of our website. The github link to this project is also linked above. A demo of this application working is below. Through this project I was able to learn a lot about accountability and following what you believe is right. I also learnt how to manage my time wisely and break things up to achieve most efficient solution.</p>
