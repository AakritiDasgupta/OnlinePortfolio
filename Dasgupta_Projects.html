          <p style="color:#3f246b">For this project, we were assigned the task to create a game or story with multiple levels/acts that progressed towards a specific goal or storyline. My partner and I weighed various options and narrowed it down to create a racing game using the Scratch programming language. The game involved a fast pace chase between bank robbers and the police. The game was designed to become progressively gain speed with the player/robber getting a car upgrade after the successful completion of each level. The project was designed for us to enhance our skills using Scratch, programming language, and understand its possibilities and limitations. Another essential aspect of this project was for us to learn and understand the importance of proper documentation - clear instructions, proper design document and outlining one's daily activities were the key points. My partner and I understood our strengths and weakness and distributed the work accordingly. However, we also ensured that each one of us worked on aspects that were out of our comfort zone. We faced challenges around communication and overcame it through emails. Additionally, we peer-reviewed each other's work which helped us get insight on each other's perspective and improved the overall quality of our game. A critical lesson that we learned with this project was that we must always design a game or a product keeping in mind the perspective of the end-user or player. In the spirit of making the game complicated, we must not forget to acknowledge the entertainment aspect of the game.</p>

        <p style="color:#3f246b">For this project, we were assigned to use the SCRUM methodology to make a hangman game in 45-50 minutes. However, we must ensure that we use the given code and also include a theme.After a few ideas being bounced around the four of us came the conclusion that the theme of the game is Harry Potter. Which means our hangman game will have different Harry Potter related terms each round. Our first step was to divide the work to prevent any confusion. After the discussion, I was to work on the scrum planning,backlog and review and in any free time I would help check and finish the code. This project opened my eyes to a different way of documentation. I learnt about SCRUM methodology and how that gives people flexibility and gives no room for slacking off. We had to add details at different times and this documentation allowed us to easily implement these changes. This method also ensured that all members are all working simulatneouly. Our greatest challenge was the time restraint as we had never had such a tight time constraint. Although we were overwhelmed we understood that communication was key. We had to ensure that all of us knew what was expected of us and ask for help when we needed it. I think our communication was easy because we all had the ability to admit our strengths and weaknesses. That confession allowed us to easily divide the work into equal chunks for everyone. Our problem-solving skills also allowed us to be flexible and with the SCRUM methodology we were able to easily delete and add things to our project.</p>

          <p style="color:#3f246b">Our aim for this project was to create a trap that can humanely capture Santa but ensure that he was released. My responsibility in this project consisted of handling the documentation, formatting, and build a portion of the actual prototype. Our group had split up the work for this project by delegating tasks to people rather than splitting every part of the project evenly. This process of assigning tasks allowed me to understand how to split up work efficiently. While also being able to capitalize on one's best skills. Since this was a socially distanced project, I was able to further my understanding of the importance of communication. While also teaching me how to work with people without necessarily being face to face. This class also introduced me to a more thorough form of documentation, specifically teaching me how to create a Design Brief and a Final Design Description.

          <p style="color:#3f246b">OOur aim for this project was to create a two-lane bridge over Trinity Lake that must be 12 -24 meters above water level. In this project, I was the project manager and my job consisted of assigning tasks and making sure everyone finishes their work in a timely fashion. I also handled the majority of the documentation in this project. Through this project, I learned the importance of being able to ask for help. I have always loved doing documentation and hence took over the majority of it this time as well. However, as the days went by I found myself struggling and spending countless hours attempting to figure it out myself. Through this process, I learned how to tell my other partners that I was struggling. I understood the importance of relying on my partners for help instead of braving it myself. This project also helped further my understanding of bridges and brought to light the amount of work behind building a bridge.

          <p style="color:#3f246b">Our aim for this project was to successfully create a board game, that not only demonstrated our knowledge of java but was also entertaining. We were not required to complete any documentation for this project so our team agreed upon splitting up the code into bite-sized sections. We then, evenly, split these bite-sized sections between all three of us. One of the lessons that I took from this project was the importance of avoiding procrastination. This project was challenging and required us to think innovatively. Due to the difficulty and ambiguity of this project, we were initially given three weeks. During the first two weeks, I found myself putting this project aside and focusing on other tasks. At this point, the class was also given a one-week extension. Instead, of using this extension wisely I decided to, again, put the project on hold and focus on other tasks. Another extension was given to the entire class. During this time my team I was finally able to break out of this cycle of procrastination and diligently worked on our project. We collaborated and were pleased with our end result. However, through this project, I was able to learn that procrastination only makes a task harder. Instead of avoiding a daunting task, one should jump in and embrace the challenges; As I was also able to learn a great deal from this project.
