        <h5>Course: Computer Science Principles</h5>
        <h5>Duration: Sep 3, 2019 - Sep 11, 2019</h5>
        <h5>Objective: To create a game or story with multiple levels/acts that progresses towards a specific goal or storyline. </h5>
        <h5>Type of Project : 2 people</h5>
        <p style="color:#1b012e">For this project, we were assigned the task to create a game or story with multiple levels/acts that progressed towards a specific goal or storyline. My partner and I weighed various options and narrowed it down to create a racing game using the Scratch programming language. The game involved a fast pace chase between bank robbers and the police. The game was designed to become progressively gain speed with the player/robber getting a car upgrade after the successful completion of each level. The project was designed for us to enhance our skills using Scratch, programming language, and understand its possibilities and limitations. Another essential aspect of this project was for us to learn and understand the importance of proper documentation - clear instructions, proper design document and outlining one's daily activities were the key points. My partner and I understood our strengths and weakness and distributed the work accordingly. However, we also ensured that each one of us worked on aspects that were out of our comfort zone. We faced challenges around communication and overcame it through emails. Additionally, we peer-reviewed each other's work which helped us get insight on each other's perspective and improved the overall quality of our game. A critical lesson that we learned with this project was that we must always design a game or a product keeping in mind the perspective of the end-user or player. In the spirit of making the game complicated, we must not forget to acknowledge the entertainment aspect of the game. </p>
