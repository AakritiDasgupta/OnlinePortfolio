          <p style="color:#3f246b">For this project, we were assigned the task to create a game or story with multiple levels/acts that progressed towards a specific goal or storyline. My partner and I weighed various options and narrowed it down to create a racing game using the Scratch programming language. The game involved a fast pace chase between bank robbers and the police. The game was designed to become progressively gain speed with the player/robber getting a car upgrade after the successful completion of each level. The project was designed for us to enhance our skills using Scratch, programming language, and understand its possibilities and limitations. Another essential aspect of this project was for us to learn and understand the importance of proper documentation - clear instructions, proper design document and outlining one's daily activities were the key points. My partner and I understood our strengths and weakness and distributed the work accordingly. However, we also ensured that each one of us worked on aspects that were out of our comfort zone. We faced challenges around communication and overcame it through emails. Additionally, we peer-reviewed each other's work which helped us get insight on each other's perspective and improved the overall quality of our game. A critical lesson that we learned with this project was that we must always design a game or a product keeping in mind the perspective of the end-user or player. In the spirit of making the game complicated, we must not forget to acknowledge the entertainment aspect of the game.</p>

        <p style="color:#3f246b">For this project, we were assigned to use the SCRUM methodology to make a hangman game in 45-50 minutes. However, we must ensure that we use the given code and also include a theme.After a few ideas being bounced around the four of us came the conclusion that the theme of the game is Harry Potter. Which means our hangman game will have different Harry Potter related terms each round. Our first step was to divide the work to prevent any confusion. After the discussion, I was to work on the scrum planning,backlog and review and in any free time I would help check and finish the code. This project opened my eyes to a different way of documentation. I learnt about SCRUM methodology and how that gives people flexibility and gives no room for slacking off. We had to add details at different times and this documentation allowed us to easily implement these changes. This method also ensured that all members are all working simulatneouly. Our greatest challenge was the time restraint as we had never had such a tight time constraint. Although we were overwhelmed we understood that communication was key. We had to ensure that all of us knew what was expected of us and ask for help when we needed it. I think our communication was easy because we all had the ability to admit our strengths and weaknesses. That confession allowed us to easily divide the work into equal chunks for everyone. Our problem-solving skills also allowed us to be flexible and with the SCRUM methodology we were able to easily delete and add things to our project.</p>
