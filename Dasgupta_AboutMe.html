        <p style="color:#1b012e"> As we look ahead into the next century, leaders will be those who empower others." - Bill Gates. My goal is to empower people to innovate and use technology to make a positive impact in their communities. To achieve this, I plan to build a career centered around technology innovations that can empower others to build upon them.
<br>
<br>
To make this goal achievable and realistic, I have broken it down into phases. The first phase was to ensure that I have a strong foundation in mathematics, engineering, and science, especially computational science. I joined the engineering academy at my high school and completed classes such as AP Computer Science Principles, Honors in Principles of Engineering, Honors Chemistry, and AP Computer Science Applications. Additionally, I completed an HTML and CSS certification to enhance my technical skills.
<br>
<br>
The second phase of my plan is to refine my skills in teaching technology to others. I am currently teaching Python coding to elementary school children and have expanded my classes to include a variety of students, from elementary to high school. I am modeling my communication to match different audiences to ensure that I am effectively teaching them.
<br>
<br>
The third phase of my plan is to build a platform that facilitates learning and building on new technologies. I am currently working on the architecture and design of the phase 1 alpha and will field test it with my students.
<br>
<br>
To gain an understanding of how the corporate world works, I have pursued internship opportunities at Cisco and start-ups. These experiences have given me exposure to planning, marketing, Go-To-Market, working with customers, and more.
<br>
<br>
Working as the Historian of Key Club and Kidz4Causes has allowed me to develop collaborative team-working skills while making a meaningful impact on the community.
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, I am passionate about creating a world where innovating with technology is pervasive, and the plan I have put together will help me build the necessary foundational skills to pursue my dreams.
