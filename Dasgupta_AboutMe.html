        <p style="color:#1b012e"> As we look ahead into the next century, leaders will be those who empower others." - Bill Gates. My goal is to empower people to innovate and utilize technology to make a positive impact in their communities. To achieve this, I have outlined a career centered around technology innovations that can empower others to build upon them, which can be achieved through various phases.
<br>
<br>
Phase one revolved around prioritizing the development of a foundation in mathematics, engineering, and science, particularly computational science. To achieve this, I enrolled in the engineering academy at my high school and completed courses such as AP Computer Science Principles, Honors in Principles of Engineering, Honors Chemistry, and AP Computer Science Applications. I also completed an HTML and CSS certification to augment my technical skills.
<br>
<br>
          
The second phase involved me refining my skills of teaching technology to others. Currently, I am teaching Python coding to elementary school children and have expanded my classes to include students ranging from elementary to high school. To ensure effective communication, I am adapting my teaching style to match different audiences.
<br>
<br>
I am currently in the third phase and am working towards building a platform that promotes learning and building on new technologies. As of this moment I am almost finished with the architecture and design of the phase 1 alpha, which I will field-test with my students.
<br>
<br>
To gain a better understanding of how the corporate world works, I also pursued internship opportunities at Cisco and start-ups. These experiences have exposed me to various aspects of the corporate world, such as planning, marketing, Go-To-Market, and working with customers.
<br>
<br>
As the Historian of Key Club and a member on the Board of Directors for Kidz4Causes, I have also had the opportunity to develop collaborative team-working skills while making a meaningful impact on the community.
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, my passion for creating a world where technology innovation is ubiquitous is what drives me. The plan I have put together will equip me with the foundational skills necessary to pursue my dreams and empower others along the way.
