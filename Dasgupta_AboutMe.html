        <p style="color:#1b012e"> Access to affordable healthcare is one of biggest challenges today and technology has potential answers to solving these problems. I want to bring together my passion for healthcare and computer engineering together to solve these problems. I aspire to work as a computer engineer building technology platforms addressing critical issues in this field.
       <br>
       <br>
       I have put together a four phase execution plan to achieve this goal. The plan consists of an Understanding the problems phase, understanding what is happening today to solve these problems, narrowing down on three to four critical areas that I can contribute and creating an execution path for contributing to the chosen areas.
      <br>
      <br>
      Currently I am in the in the understanding of the problems phase. I believe finding scalable methods to get healthcare to people in remote areas, creating a patient centric experience, advanced machine learning and robotics in medicine and implementing transparency in healthcare costs are the biggest challenges to solve for.
    <br>
    <br>
    Over the next three years I will be working on the next three phases of my execution plan. My skills around introductory health and forensic sciences ( 4.0 score in medical detectives), computing skills and ability to communicate will be foundations I will build on to achieve my gaols.
   <br>
   <br>
    I am in my freshman year in High School and I have a lot to learn, understand and comprehend to achieve my goal of solving challenges in healthcare through technology. I believe with the plan I have outlined, guidance from my teachers and family and volunteering opportunities, I will be able to contribute towards creating a world where healthcare is achievable for all.
