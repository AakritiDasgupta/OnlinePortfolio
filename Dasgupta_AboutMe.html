        <p style="color:#1b012e"> “As we look ahead into the next century, leaders will be those who empower others.” - Bill Gates. My goal is to find ways to empower people to innovate on and use technology to make things better. I want to build a career that centers around technology innovations that can empower others to build on top of it. A big part of it is to help people from different backgrounds and demographics to learn how to easily use technology platforms to build their own business models, create computations models and frameworks at different levels of complexity. Innovations and discoveries that have contributed to the progress of the human kind have been able to have that impact only if they are widely available, easily accessible and easy to build upon. Hence, my goals are now aligned to technological innovation but also to empower others to take advantage of it at a large scale. 
<br>
<br>
Any goal has to be broken down into a plan to make it achievable and realistic. Additionally, there are certain foundational characteristics that are important to achieve a certain goal. I have evaluated my strengths and weaknesses before deciding on my goal and have put together a phased plan that I am executing on to achieve my goals. 
<br>
<br>
The first phase of my plan was to ensure that I had the aptitude to realistically pursue my goals and build a strong base for the same. My academics have always demonstrated that I have a strong acumen for mathematics, engineering and science, especially computational science and have had straight A's in these areas on track to do the same in High School. I took classes in engineering and robotics over my summers in middle school. I have taken an AP course in Computer Science Principles as a Freshman, I am currently pursuing Honors in Principles of Engineering and Honors Chemistry. I have also successfully completed a HTML and CSS certification. 
<br>
<br>
The next phase of my plan is to refine my skills in teaching technology to others. I have recently started my first job teaching python coding to elementary school children. I will be looking to work with middle school and high school students next year to further develop my teaching skills. 
<br>
<br>
The third phase of my plan is to build out a platform that can facilitate learning and building on new technologies. I am currently working on the architecture and design of the phase 1 alpha for the same. A big part of this will be to field test it with my own students that I teach today. 
<br>
<br>
Last but not the least, any undertaking of the type I am planning requires understanding of how the corporate world works. There are many facets that I am not aware of like planning, marketing, Go To Market, working with customers amongst others. I am pursuing various internship opportunities to gain that experience. I have also reached out to several people in the industry to be my mentor. 
<br>
<br>
Working as a team is important to make any goal successful. I work with several clubs like, Dublin Key Club, the Newspaper Team, Calfirnia Scholarship Foundation and National Honors society,that develop my skills to work collaboratively in a team while making a meaningful impact to the larger community. 
<br>
<br>
I am extremely passionate and driven to create a world where innovating with technology is pervasive. Working through the plan I have put together will help me build the foundational skills to pursue my dreams.
